# Assignment 4 - APIs!
## About the API
This API is all about crafting. Here you will be able to find various different craft activities and what is required to do them.
You will also be able to add new craft activities and items to the database.
## What you need to do
To run this API you will need to import mysql.connector, requests, json and from flask import Flask, jsonify, request.

To install mysql.connector: in Git enter 'pip install mysql-connector-python'.

To install requests: in Git enter 'pip install requests'.

To install flask: in Git enter 'pip install flask'

Once installed, the 'import' at the top of the python file should work. Json should already be installed.

There is a 'config' file that will need the 'host', 'username' and 'password' changing. These should be the username for mysql and your password for it. The 'host' will show on mysql, usually it is 'localhost' but for mine it needed '127.0.0.1'.

## Run this API
To run the API you will need to make sure all files are saved in the same repository. Once you have opened the files, right click in the 'craft_api' file and run that.
Once you have the API running, you can enter the 'craft_client' file and right click in there, and run that. Follow the instructions in your console.

Enjoy!
